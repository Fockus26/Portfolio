# 🌐 Portfolio – Personal Website

A personal portfolio website built with Python (Flask), HTML, and CSS.

---

## 🌍 Overview

Portfolio is my very first web project, created as part of the **100 Days of Python** course.

The website was designed to:

- Introduce myself
- Showcase my projects (initially placeholders)
- Provide a simple way for visitors to get in touch

Inspired by a Canva template, it was fully implemented from scratch using Flask and Jinja templates.

## ✨ Features

- 🏠 Home page with introduction and personal background
- 📂 Projects section (initial placeholder for future projects)
- 📞 Contact page linked to WhatsApp for easy communication
- 🖼 Template system with reusable `base.html`
- 🎨 Responsive design with custom CSS

## 📖 Case Study

This project served as my entry point into web development.

While simple in functionality, it represents my first hands-on experience with Flask, HTML, and CSS. It also demonstrates how I approached design adaptation (from Canva inspiration to code) and laid the foundation for future projects such as Blog and Café.
